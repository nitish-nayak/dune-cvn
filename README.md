# The DUNE Convolutional Visual Network for neutrino interaction classification

This is a fork of the minimal working example of the main DUNE CVN repo [here](https://github.com/DUNE/dune-cvn) with the accompanying reference [here](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.092003). 
The fork allows more flexibility in studying the DUNE CVN pre-trained model on neutrino images from the DUNE Far Detector and is meant for tutorials and such. 
Check notebook provided in [dune_cvn.ipynb](dune_cvn.ipynb) for more details on playing around with input images, testing the pre-trained model and evaluating performance based on various metrics. The requirements to run it are provided in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
